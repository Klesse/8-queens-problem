## Solution approach

This solution is based in a genetic algorithm. This kind of algorithm is based on natural evolution to 
evolve mathematical solutions based in a fitness function.

A fitness function is the function that defines if the solution is valid or not, and how much valid it is.

With the fitness function the algorithm can evolve a solution to the direction which maximizes (or minimizes) its return value.
